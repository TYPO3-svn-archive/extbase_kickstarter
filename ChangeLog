Status 10.9.2010 (Nico de Haen)

1. We have an an import tool that can parse a PHP class and 
	build a "ClassSchema" object that keeps all information 
	about the class, including properties, constants, methods 
	and comments. It is possible to create a class file based 
	on such a ClassSchema without loss of any source code.

2. The CodeGenerator generates the class files by passing a 
	ClassSchema object to the view which generates the class 
	based on a  fluid class template. This ClassSchema can be 
	generated based on the JSON coming from the kickstarter, 
	or on a ClassSchema imported by the import tool or a combination 
	of both

3. Currently it is only possible to ADD methods or properties with 
	the kickstarter or by modification of the source code, but it 
	is not possible to REMOVE properties or RENAME properties or classes, 
	since the Kickstarter does not provide informations of the identity 
	of a (renamed or deleted) property.

4. The roundtrip functionality is only implemented for the class files, 
	not yet for the tca, tables.sql localconf.php files etc.

Important modifications compared to the trunk:
1. Extension keeps MD5 values of all files to detect manual modifications

2. AbstractProperty class is renamed to AbstractDomainProperty to avoid confusion 
	because we also have a ClassProperty class now.

3. The templates for the class files changed completly. They keep only very few information now. 

4. The import of existing class files is performed in the CodeGenerator 
	generateDomain...Code methods by a call $this->classSchemaBuilder->generateModelClassSchema($domainObject);

3. New Files: 
	Classes/Domain/Model/AbstractGenericSchema: 
		The base for all objects related to PHP Class objects. (Methods, Properties, Classes etc.)
	Classes/Domain/Model/Class/Schema.php, Method.php, Property.php, MethodParameter.php: 
		classes representing parts of the classSchema
	Classes/ClassSchemaBuilder.php:
		The Class providing methods to build the Model, Controller and Repository classes
	Utility/Import.php:
		The import tool, that parses a php class file (mostly with reg expressions and the php reflection) and returns a ClassSchema
	Reflection/ClassReflection.php, MethodReflection.php, ParameterReflection.php, PropertyReflection.php:
		Extends the extbaseReflection classes with various additional methods
